# MoneyPoly

An extremely simple iOS app for “cashless payments” in board games such as Monopoly.<br>
The app allows players to avoid using toy money, which is often printed on ordinary cheap paper not meant to be used as real cash. Such "money" is inconvenient to handle, and moreover often takes up a lot of space on the table.

## For users
The scenario of use assumes that players mutually uses this app on the iPad on a table and/or broadcasts on the large TV screen from the iPhone.

## For developers
The app is created as a pet project, mainly to enhance my developer skills. All elements of the interface are made with code, WITHOUT usage of Storyboard. I did my best to code as clear as possible, all methods and instances are documented, please feel free to use any part of this code to any of your projects.
